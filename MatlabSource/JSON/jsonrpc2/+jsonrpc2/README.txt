GETTING STARTED
---------------
1) Assumed you already downloaded jsonrpc2 package since you are reading this file. 
2) Download jsonlab from http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/33381-jsonlab-a-toolbox-to-encodedecode-json-files-in-matlaboctave.
3) Make sure the +jsonrpc2 package and jsonlab are on the MATLAB file path.


RECOMMENDED
-----------
Run tests prior to use.  All tests should pass.  See +jsonrpc2Tests/README.txt for information on running tests.


EXAMPLES
--------
% Request Example:

id = 1;
method = 'concat';
params = struct;
params.s1 = 'Hello ';
params.s2 = 'World';
request1 = jsonrpc2.JSONRPC2Request(id, method, params );
requestJson = request1.toJSONString();

request2 = jsonrpc2.JSONRPC2Request.parse(requestJson);


% Response Example:

id = 1;
result = 'Hello World';
response1 = jsonrpc2.JSONRPC2Response(id, results );
responseJson = response1.toJSONString();

response2 = jsonrpc2.JSONRPC2Response.parse(responseJson);
